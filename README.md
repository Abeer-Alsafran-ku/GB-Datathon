## Description 🚀
Welcome to the Gulf Bank Datathon GenAi track! This competition challenges participants to leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence to solve real-world problems in the travel/flight agencies ✈️. 

## Approach  📝
In this section, participants should outline their approach to solving the problem presented in the datathon. This may include the methodologies, algorithms, and techniques they plan to use. Participants are encouraged to be clear and concise, explaining their reasoning behind the chosen approach.

## Implementation 💻
Here, participants should detail the steps they took to implement their solution. This may include data preprocessing, model building, fine-tuning, and any other relevant processes. Code snippets or references to the main implementation files are welcome to provide clarity and reproducibility. 

## Result 📊
Finally, The result was not bad! we got a really good accurecy and it was responding well, but the problem was with integrating the model we built with the UI framework, which made difficulties to render the response in UI, but as a model output it was great. 🤖

## Important Notes 🎉
- There were no dataset provided.
- Very important to integrate API's to generate real data and live data.
